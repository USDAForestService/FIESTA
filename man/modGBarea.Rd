\description{
Generates area estimates by domain (and estimation unit). Calculations are
based on Scott et al. 2005 ('the green-book') for mapped forest inventory
plots. The non-ratio estimator for estimating area by stratum and domain is
used. Plots that are totally nonsampled are excluded from estimation
dataset. Next, an adjustment factor is calculated by strata to adjust for
nonsampled (nonresponse) conditions that have proportion less than 1. The
attribute is the proportion of the plot which is divided by the adjustment
factor, and averaged by stratum. Strata means are combined using the strata
weights and then expanded to area using the total land area in the
population.

For available reference tables: sort(unique(FIESTAutils::ref_codes$VARIABLE)) \cr
}
\note{
ADJUSTMENT FACTOR:\cr The adjustment factor is necessary to account for
nonsampled conditions. It is calculated for each estimation unit by strata
by summing the unadjusted condition proportions (CONDPROP_UNADJ) and
dividing by the number of plots in the strata/estimation unit.

If ACI=FALSE, only nonsampled forest conditions are accounted for in the
adjustment factor. \cr If ACI=TRUE, the nonsampled nonforest conditions are
removed as well and accounted for in adjustment factor. This is if you are
interested in estimates for all lands or nonforest lands in the
All-Condition-Inventory.

STRATA:\cr Stratification is used to reduce variance in population estimates
by partitioning the population into homogenous classes (strata), such as
forest and nonforest. For stratified sampling methods, the strata sizes
(weights) must be either known or estimated. Remotely-sensed data is often
used to generate strata weights with proporation of pixels by strata. If
stratification is desired (strata=TRUE), the required data include: stratum
assignment for the center location of each plot, stored in either pltassgn
or cond; and a look-up table with the area or proportion of the total area
of each strata value by estimation unit, making sure the name of the strata
(and estimation unit) variable and values match the plot assignment name(s)
and value(s).

sumunits:\cr An estimation unit is a population, or area of interest, with
known area and number of plots. Individual counties or combined
Super-counties are common estimation units for FIA. An estimation unit may
also be a subpopulation of a larger population (e.g., Counties within a
State). Subpopulations are mutually exclusive and independent within a
population, therefore estimated totals and variances are additive. For
example, State-level estimates are generated by summing estimates from all
subpopulations within the State (Bechtold and Patterson. 2005. Chapter 2).
Each plot must be assigned to only one estimation unit.

If sumunits=TRUE, estimates are generated by estimation unit, summed
together, and returned as one estimate. If rawdata=TRUE, estimates by
individual estimation unit are also returned.

If sumunits=FALSE, estimates are generated and returned by estimation unit
as one data frame. If savedata=TRUE, a separate file is written for each
estimation unit.

stratcombine:\cr If TRUE and less than 2 plots in any one estimation unit,
all estimation units with 10 or less plots are combined. The current method
for combining is to group the estimation unit with less than 10 plots with
the estimation unit following in consecutive order (numeric or
alphabetical), restrained by survey unit (UNITCD) if included in dataset,
and continuing until the number of plots equals 10. If there are no
estimation units following in order, it is combined with the estimation unit
previous in order.

rowlut/collut:\cr There are several objectives for including rowlut/collut
look-up tables: 1) to include descriptive names that match row/column codes
in the input table; 2) to use number codes that match row/column names in
the input table for ordering rows; 3) to add rows and/or columns with 0
values for consistency. No duplicate names are allowed.

Include 2 columns in the table:\cr 1-the merging variable with same name as
the variable in the input merge table;\cr 2-the ordering or descriptive
variable.\cr If the ordering variable is the rowvar/colvar in the input
table and the descriptive variable is in rowlut/collut, set
row.orderby/col.orderby equal to rowvar/colvar. If the descriptive variable
is the rowvar/colvar in the input table, and the ordering code variable is
in rowlut/collut, set row.orderby/col.orderby equal to the variable name of
the code variable in rowlut/collut.
