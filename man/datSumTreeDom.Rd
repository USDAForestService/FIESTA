\description{
Aggregates numeric tree domain data (e.g., SPCD) to plot or condition,
including options for filtering tree data or extrapolating to plot acre by
multiplying by TPA. Includes options for generating barplots, proportion
data, and cover data.
}
\details{
If variable = NULL, then it will prompt user for input.

If you want to get trees-per-acre information aggregated to plot or
condition level, you need to include a TPA variable in tree table. \cr For
tsumvars = GROWCFGS, GROWBFSL, GROWCFAL, FGROWCFGS, FGROWBFSL, or FGROWCFAL,
you must have TPAGROW_UNADJ \cr For tsumvars = MORTCFGS, MORTBFSL, MORTCFAL,
FMORTCFGS, FMORTBFSL, or FMORTCFAL, you must have TPAMORT_UNADJ \cr For
tsumvars = REMVCFGS, REMVBFSL, REMVCFAL, FREMVCFGS, FREMVBFSL, or FREMVCFAL,
you must have TPAREMV_UNADJ \cr

If you want to adjust plot-level information by condition proportions, you
need to include CONDID & CONDPROP_UNADJ in cond or tree table. \cr

If you want to adjust the aggregated tree data by the area of the strata
(estimation unit), you need to either have a variable in your tree data
named adjfact or you need to included the following variables in your
datasets: \cr Condition table: STATECD, CONDID, STRATA, ESTUNIT,
SUBPPROP_UNADJ, MICRPROP_UNADJ (if microplot trees) MACRPROP_UNADJ (if
macroplot trees). \cr Tree table: TPA_UNADJ

All trees where DIA=NA are removed from analysis. These are trees that were
remeasured but are no longer in inventory (ex. a tree that is dead and not
standing in the current inventory).

\note{
This function can be used to get tree domain data. This data can be
used for mapping tree domain distributions.
