\description{
Generates population data for generating 'green-book' estimates (Scott et
al. 2005).  Plots that are totally nonsampled are excluded from estimation
dataset. Next, an adjustment factor is calculated by strata to adjust for
nonsampled (nonresponse) conditions that have proportion less than 1.
Attributes adjusted to a per-acre value are summed by plot, divided by the
adjustment factor, and averaged by stratum.  Strata means are combined using
the strata weights and then expanded to using the total land area in the
population.

\note{
ADJUSTMENT FACTOR:\cr The adjustment factor is necessary to account for
nonsampled conditions. It is calculated for each estimation unit by strata.
by summing the unadjusted proportions of the subplot, microplot, and
macroplot (i.e. *PROP_UNADJ) and dividing by the number of plots in the
strata/estimation unit).

An adjustment factor is determined for each tree based on the size of the
plot it was measured on. This is identified using TPA_UNADJ as follows:

\tabular{llr}{ \tab \bold{PLOT SIZE} \tab \bold{TPA_UNADJ} \cr \tab SUBPLOT
\tab 6.018046 \cr \tab MICROPLOT \tab 74.965282 \cr \tab MACROPLOT \tab
0.999188 \cr }

If ACI=FALSE, only nonsampled forest conditions are accounted for in the
adjustment factor. \cr If ACI=TRUE, the nonsampled nonforest conditions are
removed as well and accounted for in adjustment factor.  This is if you are
interested in estimates for all lands or nonforest lands in the
All-Condition-Inventory.

unitcombine:\cr If TRUE and less than 2 plots in any one estimation unit,
all estimation units with 10 or less plots are combined. The current method
for combining is to group the estimation unit with less than 10 plots with
the estimation unit following in consecutive order (numeric or
alphabetical), restrained by survey unit (UNITCD) if included in dataset,
and continuing until the number of plots equals 10. If there are no
estimation units following in order, it is combined with the estimation unit
previous in order.

stratcombine:\cr If TRUE and less than 2 plots in any one strata class
within an estimation unit, all strata classes with 2 or less plots are
combined. The current method for combining is to group the strata with less
than 2 plots with the strata class following in consecutive order (numeric
or alphabetical), restrained by estimation unit (if unitcombine=FALSE), and
continuing until the number of plots equals 10. If there are no strata
classes following in order, it is combined with the estimation unit previous
in order.
