If FIA=TRUE or unitvar=NULL and colvar=NULL, one data frame is
returned with tree estimates and percent sample errors. Otherwise, a list is
returned with tree estimates in one data frame (est) and percent sample
errors in another data frame (est.pse). If rawdata=TRUE, another list is
returned including raw data used in the estimation process.  If
addtitle=TRUE and returntitle=TRUE, the title for est/pse is returned. If
savedata=TRUE, all data frames are written to outfolder.

unit). If FIA=TRUE or one estimation unit and colvar=NULL, estimates and
percent sampling error are in one data frame. } \item{pse}{ Data frame.

unit). } \item{titlelst}{ List with 1 or 2 string vectors. If
returntitle=TRUE a list with table title(s). The list contains one title if

\note{
ADJUSTMENT FACTOR:\cr The adjustment factor is necessary to account for
nonsampled conditions. It is calculated for each estimation unit by strata.
by summing the unadjusted proportions of the subplot, microplot, and
macroplot (i.e. *PROP_UNADJ) and dividing by the number of plots in the
strata/estimation unit).

An adjustment factor is determined for each tree based on the size of the
plot it was measured on. This is identified using TPA_UNADJ as follows:

\tabular{llr}{ \tab \bold{PLOT SIZE} \tab \bold{TPA_UNADJ} \cr \tab SUBPLOT
\tab 6.018046 \cr \tab MICROPLOT \tab 74.965282 \cr \tab MACROPLOT \tab
0.999188 \cr }

If ACI=FALSE, only nonsampled forest conditions are accounted for in the
adjustment factor. \cr If ACI=TRUE, the nonsampled nonforest conditions are
removed as well and accounted for in adjustment factor.  This is if you are
interested in estimates for all lands or nonforest lands in the
All-Condition-Inventory.

sumunits:\cr An estimation unit is a population, or area of interest, with
known area and number of plots. Individual counties or combined
Super-counties are common estimation units for FIA. An estimation unit may
also be a subpopulation of a larger population (e.g., Counties within a
State). Subpopulations are mutually exclusive and independent within a
population, therefore estimated totals and variances are additive. For
example, State-level estimates are generated by summing estimates from all
subpopulations within the State (Bechtold and Patterson. 2005. Chapter 2).
Each plot must be assigned to only one estimation unit.

stratcombine:\cr If MAmethod='PS', and stratcombine=TRUE, and less than 2
plots in any one estimation unit, all estimation units with 10 or less plots
are combined. The current method for combining is to group the estimation
unit with less than 10 plots with the estimation unit following in
consecutive order (numeric or alphabetical), restrained by survey unit
(UNITCD) if included in dataset, and continuing until the number of plots
equals 10. If there are no estimation units following in order, it is
combined with the estimation unit previous in order.

autoxreduce:\cr If MAmethod='GREG', and autoxreduce=TRUE, and there is an
error because of multicolinearity, a variable reduction method is applied to
remove correlated variables. The method used is based on the
variance-inflation factor (vif) from a linear model. The vif estimates how
much the variance of each x variable is inflated due to mulitcolinearity in
the model.

rowlut/collut:\cr There are several objectives for including rowlut/collut
look-up tables: 1) to include descriptive names that match row/column codes
in the input table; 2) to use number codes that match row/column names in
the input table for ordering rows; 3) to add rows and/or columns with 0
values for consistency. No duplicate names are allowed.

Include 2 columns in the table:\cr 1-the merging variable with same name as
the variable in the input merge table;\cr 2-the ordering or descriptive
variable.\cr If the ordering variable is the rowvar/colvar in the input
table and the descriptive variable is in rowlut/collut, set
row.orderby/col.orderby equal to rowvar/colvar. If the descriptive variable
is the rowvar/colvar in the input table, and the ordering code variable is
in rowlut/collut, set row.orderby/col.orderby equal to the variable name of
the code variable in rowlut/collut.

UNITS:\cr The following variables are converted from pounds (from FIA
database) to short tons by multiplying the variable by 0.0005.  DRYBIO_AG,
DRYBIO_BG, DRYBIO_WDLD_SPP, DRYBIO_SAPLING, DRYBIO_STUMP, DRYBIO_TOP,
DRYBIO_BOLE, DRYBIOT, DRYBIOM, DRYBIOTB, JBIOTOT, CARBON_BG, CARBON_AG

MORTALITY:\cr For Interior-West FIA, mortality estimates are mainly based on
whether a tree has died within the last 5 years of when the plot was
measured. If a plot was remeasured, mortality includes trees that were alive
the previous visit but were dead in the next visit. If a tree was standing
the previous visit, but was not standing in the next visit, no diameter was
collected (DIA = NA) but the tree is defined as mortality.
