## Overview

The R package, `FIESTA` (Forest Inventory ESTimation and Analysis) is a research estimation tool for analysts that work with sample-based inventory data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. `FIESTA` can generate FIA's traditional state-wide estimates while also accommodate: unique population boundaries, different evaluation time periods, customized stratification schemes, non-standard variance equations, integration of multi-scale remotely-sensed data and other auxiliary information, and interaction with other modeling and estimation tools from CRAN's library of packages. `FIESTA` contains a collection of functions that can query FIA databases, summarize and compile plot and spatial data, and generate estimates with associated sampling errors. 

Functions are organized by type or objective and are named with a corresponding prefix (Fig. 1). `FIESTA` core functions (CORE) facilitate data extraction and compilation of data input information and are used independently or within the `FIESTA` estimation modules. `FIESTA` estimation modules (MODULE) combine multiple functions from `FIESTA` or other packages to generate population estimates using different estimation strategies. Each module has an associated `mod*pop` function for compiling the population data and calculations (e.g., adjustments for nonresponse, standardizing auxiliary data) for a custom boundary and can be used for generating multiple estimates. `FIESTA` analysis functions, found in the `FIESTAnalysis` package, streamline different estimation routines by wrapping (i.e., combining) estimation modules and other functions for a specific purpose. 

##### Core Functions

* Database tools (`DB*`) - functions for querying and extracting data from FIA's national database.
* Data tools (`dat*`) - functions for summarizing and exploring FIA data.
* Spatial tools (`sp*`) - functions for manipulating and summarizing spatial data.

##### Estimation Modules (mod)

* Green-Book (`modGB*`) - functions for FIA's standard Green-Book estimators.
* Photo-Based (`modPB*`) - functions for supplementary photo-based estimators.
* Small Area (`modSA*`) - functions for integration with available small area estimators (SAE).
* Model-Assisted (`modMA*`) - functions for integration with available Model-Assisted estimators.

##### Analysis Functions

* Analysis functions (`an*`) - wrapper functions for steam-lining estimation processes. These functions reside in the `FIESTAnalysis` package. 

## Installation

#### Stable installation

You can install the current stable version of `FIESTA` from CRAN:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("FIESTA")
```

#### Developmental installation

Or, if you'd like to install the developmental version of `FIESTA`, you can do so through a few steps:

##### 1. Install Rtools or xcode 

If you are using the Windows OS, in order to install source code from GitHub, you must install Rtools from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Install the most current Rtools for Windows 64-bit at [this link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). 

If you are using macOS, you'll need to install xcode developer tools to install source code from GitHub. To do so, run the following code in your terminal (not the R console):

```
xcode-select --install
```

##### 2. Install the developmental version of `FIESTA` (and `FIESTAutils`)

First note that the developmental version of `FIESTA` may rely on a developmental version of `FIESTAutils`. For both of these installations, you'll need to make sure to have the `remotes` package, and then you can install both packages from GitHub:

```{r, eval = F}
# Install developmental FIESTAutils first
remotes::install_github("USDAForestService/FIESTAutils",
                        dependencies = TRUE)

# Then install developmental FIESTA
remotes::install_github("USDAForestService/FIESTA",
                        dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Accessing Documentation

### Vignettes

The vignette tutorials from `FIESTA` can be accessed from [the package website](https://usdaforestservice.github.io/FIESTA/articles/). The vignettes are split up into a few groups: general manuals ([Module Estimates](https://usdaforestservice.github.io/FIESTA/articles/FIESTA_manual_mod_est.html) and [Population Data](https://usdaforestservice.github.io/FIESTA/articles/FIESTA_manual_mod_pop.html)), core functions ([Database Tools](https://usdaforestservice.github.io/FIESTA/articles/FIESTA_tutorial_DB.html), [Data Tools](https://usdaforestservice.github.io/FIESTA/articles/FIESTA_tutorial_dat.html), and [Spatial Tools](https://usdaforestservice.github.io/FIESTA/articles/FIESTA_tutorial_sp.html)), and estimation modules ([Green-book Estimators](https://usdaforestservice.github.io/FIESTA/articles/FIESTA_tutorial_GB.html), [Model-Assisted Estimators](https://usdaforestservice.github.io/FIESTA/articles/FIESTA_tutorial_MA.html), [Small Area Estimators](https://usdaforestservice.github.io/FIESTA/articles/FIESTA_tutorial_SA.html), and [Photo-Based Module](https://usdaforestservice.github.io/FIESTA/articles/FIESTA_tutorial_PB.html)). We suggest you read the general manuals first if you are new to `FIESTA`. 

### External Data

You can access documentation for external data included in `FIESTA` in the [`extdata-README.md` file](inst/extdata-README.md).

## Examples 

These examples make use of vignettes that come with `FIESTA`, and these vignettes can be found by calling `vignette(package = "FIESTA")`. The data used in these examples come with the `FIESTA` package and are from Wyoming, inventory years 2011-2013 (Evaluation 561301). We first load `FIESTA` to run these examples:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```

```{r, eval = F}
library(FIESTA)
```

### Example 1: Green-book estimation

In order to produce estimates based on the Green-book, we first use the `GBpopdat` function to produce population data for our areas of interest. We can look at a summary of the population data below. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = F}
GBpopdat <- modGBpop(popTabs = list(cond = FIESTA::WYcond,  
                                    tree = FIESTA::WYtree),      
                     popTabIDs = list(cond = "PLT_CN"),
                     pltassgn = FIESTA::WYpltassgn,
                     pltassgnid = "CN",
                     pjoinid = "PLT_CN",
                     unitarea = FIESTA::WYunitarea,
                     unitvar = "ESTN_UNIT", 
                     strata = TRUE,
                     stratalut = FIESTA::WYstratalut,
                     strata_opts = strata_options(getwt = TRUE))

summary(GBpopdat)
```

Note that the `GBpopdat` list generated by `modGBpop` contains many items. Some examples include the number of plots by plot status (`plotsampcnt`), the number of conditions by condition status (`condsampcnt`), the strata-level population data, including number of plots and adjustment factors (`stratalut`), and the adjustment factors added to the condition-level, tree-level, and seedling data (`condx`, `treex`, and `seedx`, respectfully).

Now, with the `GBpopdat` object, we can quickly produce estimates of basal area (`estvar = "BA"`) by county in Wyoming for the 2011-2013 years.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = F}
GBest <- modGBtree(GBpopdat = GBpopdat,
                   estvar = "BA",
                   estvar.filter = "STATUSCD == 1",
                   sumunits = FALSE)
```

We again output a list, now with estimates/standard errors, raw data, state code, and inventory year:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = F}
str(GBest, max.level = 2)
```

### Example 2: Model-assisted estimation

`FIESTA` makes it easy to do estimation through techniques such as model-assited estimation and small area estimation. In this example, we use a similar process to the Green-Book estimation above to produce estimates for the same region, but through a generalized regression (GREG) model-assisted estimator. First, we get our population data:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = F}
MApopdat <- modMApop(popTabs = list(tree = FIESTA::WYtree,
                                    cond = FIESTA::WYcond),
                     pltassgn = FIESTA::WYpltassgn,
                     pltassgnid = "CN",
                     unitarea = FIESTA::WYunitarea,
                     unitvar = "ESTN_UNIT",
                     unitzonal = FIESTA::WYunitzonal,
                     prednames = c("dem", "tcc", "tpi", "tnt"),
                     predfac = "tnt")
```

Now, analogous to the `modGBtree()` function we can produce estimates with the `modMAtree()` function

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = F}
MAest <- modMAtree(MApopdat = MApopdat,
                   MAmethod = "greg",
                   estvar = "BA",
                   estvar.filter = "STATUSCD == 1")
```

and we can see the output of `modMAtree()`:

```{r}
str(MAest, max.level = 2)
```
